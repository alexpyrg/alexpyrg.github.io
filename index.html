<div class="hcontainer" id="second"><div class="dlg"><h1>PC Enthusiast & Gamer</h1><p>
  I am also a PC enthusiast & a huge gamer.My father has been a computer technician since early 00's.He always wanted me to help him even when
  i was very young and he would always get new games for me and that got me more into computers.
  I've built my very own PC from scratch and helped my friends pick parts and assemble their computers.
  I do not like(hate) RGB stuff.Although it is kinda cool.That is not for me.RGB lighting raises the cost of the parts 5%-10%.
  My computer consists of a Gigabyte Z97X Gaming GT MotherBoard,Intel i7-4790k @ 4.00Ghz CPU,EVGA Nvidia Geforce GTX 1070 SC GPU,16GB of DDR3 Ram @ 1600Mhz,Corsair RM750 80 plus gold PSU,2x1TB WesternDigital Caviar Black HDD's and a 250GB SSD Crucial BX100.
  The case all those are in is the Corsair 450D(Midi-Tower).I use Intel's stock cooler.</p>
